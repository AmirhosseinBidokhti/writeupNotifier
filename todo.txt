problems:
some links are filtered, some are down(?) find a solution for that and error handling is really important here.

some feeds are not following the pattern(<link>http://x.com</link>, ...) find a solution for that.

some of the titles got the CDATA within it; that causes js to parse it undefined. find a solution for that.

do not select all links. select all <link></link> that are children to <item></item>

parsing a body response might causes errors (internet connection, timeout, dns resolve, ...) handle these properly.
